Moodle plugin for Soka / Badges processs
==

This is a specific plugin made to allow the generation of badges through Openbadge Factory through the user's email.

Installation
============

Add plugin code into the moodle local folder and run an update/upgrade.  
You should now see a new plugin and new menus under the Administration > Soka Management menu.

The call to the Ajax function needs to contain information about the session key and should be called from the same host URL so
to be validated.
